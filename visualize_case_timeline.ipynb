    "# Visualization of Patient Data Timelines\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an opportunity to explore the temporal nature of data entry for patients in an EMR. We are using a small sample from the MIMIC2 demo data set. [MIMIC](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/1.0/) is a de-identified data set of EMR data collected on patients who were in the ICU at a large academic hospital in the United States. MIMIC is publically available for research purposes. The data set we are using is from a subset of 4000 deceased invididuals from an older version of the MIMIC database (version II). \n",

    "To run this notebook select, select \"Run All Cells\" from the \"Run\" menu as shown below.\n",

    "Because the screen space might be tight, you might want to close the side bar which you can do by unselecting \"Show Left Side Bar\" in the \"View\" menu.\n",

    "## Some Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some patients generate a lot of data. The visualization tool we are using can ony visualize up to 5000 data points. Consequently I aggregated chart events and input/output events by subcategories. You can get a bit more deail using the hover tool.\n",
    "* __Microbiology events__, visualized in the bottom chart, have NULL values if no bacteria were identified in the samples. So the displayed values are simply NULL.\n",
    "* When you use the dropdown menu to select a new case, the refreshing of the chart can be a bit slow.\n",
    "* The charts have pan and zoom capability.\n",
    "* You can see more details by hovering the cursor over each circle.\n",
    "* The color of the circles encodes which provider (e.g. nurse, MD, respiratory therapist, etc.) entered the data. You can clearly see shifts in the care staff over time. Patient hand overs is one of the most challenging tasks in medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients vary in the complexity of their cases. One way the complexity of cases is quantified is through is through diagnosis-related group (`DRG`) values. A `DRG` value of 1.0, means this patient's combined medical conditions would be expected to lead to hospitalization costs of an average patient. `DRG` values greater than 1.0, mean the patient would be expected to have hospitalization costs greater than average (proportional to the `DRG` value) and `DRG` values less than 1.0 should similarly be less expensive. In this data set `DRG` values range from from 0.72  to 19.80. By comparing subjects with a range of `DRG` values, can you come up with explanations for the cost differences? \n",
